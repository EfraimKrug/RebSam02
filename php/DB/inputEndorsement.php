 'Kavanah Life is an ambitious and novel attempt to address the issue of Jewish spirituality in America.  Kavanah Life reaches into the deepest layers of Judaism, peeling away the hard shell to liberate the heart and soul of this 3500-year old spiritual tradition.  No one in contemporary America has as yet tried to do this in a systematic way.  If anyone has a chance of pulling this off and seeding a contemporary spiritual renewal, it is Rabbi Sam Intrator.  Kavanah Life deserves to be supported.  American Jews need Kavanah Life.'

 'Rabbi Sam Intrator is an authentic American-Hasid. He has been able to restore the vibrancy and openness to a broad corner of the American Jewish community by mining the deep richness and energy of that Hasidic tradition. Such a restorational activity is critical to an American Jewish revival. But restoration is not enough. There must also be a progressive component. That component must not only catch the imagination of a young American community, but also provide it with texts and canisters through which to build and store and meaning. This is what Rabbi Intrator is providing. I cannot state strongly enough how crucial this task is or how uniquely suited Rabbi Intrator is to accomplish it. I hope that the community will support his endeavor and reap the rich benefit that it will bring.  '
